# Project Objective
Climbing in the Himalayas is a physically demanding and high-risk pursuit, where the likelihood of success can vary significantly depending on various factors such as weather, team composition, oxygen use, and experience.
This project aims to investigate the impact of these factors on expedition success. By analyzing real-world expedition data, we seek to uncover actionable insights that can help climbing teams better plan and prepare for future climbs.
